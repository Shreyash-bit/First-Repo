	<p>Separating paragraphs with blank lines is easiest 
	<strong>for readers to scan, but they can also be separated
	by indenting their first lines. This is often used </strong>
	to take up less space, such as to save paper in print.</p>

	<p>Writing that is intended to be edited, such as school
	<i>papers and rough drafts, uses both blank lines and </i>
	indentation for separation. In finished works, combining 
	both is considered redundant and amateurish.</p>

	<p><b><em>In very old writing, paragraphs were separated with a </em></b>
	special character:, theNowadays, this
	is considered claustrophobic and hard to read.</p>
